**"customer-100000.csv" (Small File) - Implicit Pandas Approach**

*   **Likely Pandas Usage (Assumed):** Given the context of the first code example, the initial approach for handling "customer-100000.csv" *likely* involves using `pandas` directly. This is a common and straightforward approach for datasets that fit comfortably into memory.  While there's no explicit `pd.read_csv()` shown, it's implied by the `df.shape`, `df.head()`, `df.info()`, etc. operations.
*   **Full Load into Memory:** The pandas approach loads the entire CSV file into RAM. The system has the capacity to load the 100,000 file.

**"customers-2000000.csv" (Large File) - Explicit `dask.dataframe` Approach**

*   **`dask.dataframe` Necessity:** The second code example *explicitly* uses `dask.dataframe`. This is crucial because, in that case, the assumption is that the machine's memory capacity cannot handle reading two million files.
*   **Partitioned Data:** The large file is divided into smaller partitions which the machine can handle reading one by one. It's the way around not having large memory.

**Key Differences Summarized**

| Feature           | Small File ("customer-100000.csv")         | Large File ("customers-2000000.csv")                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Underlying Dataframe | Probably `pandas.DataFrame`                 | `dask.dataframe`                                         |
| Memory Load       | Loads entire file into memory                 | Partitions data; loads partitions on demand           |
| Code Complexity   | Simpler (direct `pandas` operations)          | More complex (requires `dask` setup, lazy evaluation)   |
| Scalability       | Limited (constrained by RAM)                   | Scalable to larger-than-memory datasets              |
| Compute time        | Faster for small computation           | Faster for large computation because of parralization |
