question: Describe what can you do with Docker / Containerize environment in the context of AI
---

**Model Deployment**:
- **Reproducible Environments**: Ensure consistent runtime across development, staging, and production
- **Dependency Management**: Package AI frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) with specific versions
- **GPU Support**: NVIDIA Docker containers for CUDA-enabled AI workloads
- **Model Serving**: Containerized inference servers (TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, Triton)

**Development Benefits**:
- **Isolation**: Separate different AI projects with conflicting dependencies
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes orchestration for auto-scaling AI services
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines for ML models
- **Resource Management**: CPU/GPU allocation and limits for AI workloads

**Operational Advantages**:
- **Multi-environment Consistency**: Same container runs identically across cloud providers
- **Microservices Architecture**: Break complex AI systems into manageable components
- **Rolling Updates**: Deploy new model versions with zero downtime
- **Monitoring**: Containerized logging and metrics collection for AI services
