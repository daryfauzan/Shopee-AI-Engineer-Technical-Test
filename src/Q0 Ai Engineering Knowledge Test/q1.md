question: Describe differences between REST API, MCP in the context of AI.
---

**REST API (Representational State Transfer)**:
- Traditional web service architecture using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Stateless communication between client and server
- In AI context: Used for model inference endpoints, data retrieval, and integration with external services
- Request-response pattern with JSON/XML payloads
- Well-established with extensive tooling and documentation

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**:
- Relatively new protocol specifically designed for AI agent interactions
- Enables structured communication between AI systems and external tools/resources
- Focuses on context sharing and tool integration for AI agents
- Designed for more complex, stateful interactions that AI agents require
- Optimized for the specific needs of LLM-based systems
