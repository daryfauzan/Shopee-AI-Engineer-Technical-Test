question: How do you ensure that your AI agent answers correctly?
---

**Validation Strategies**:
- **Ground Truth Comparison**: Validate against known correct answers in test datasets
- **Multi-model Consensus**: Use multiple models and compare outputs for consistency
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Implement review processes for critical decisions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Analyze model confidence levels and uncertainty quantification

**Technical Approaches**:
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Verify answers against authoritative sources
- **Fact-checking Pipelines**: Automated verification against knowledge bases
- **Output Parsing**: Structured validation of response formats and constraints
- **A/B Testing**: Compare different model versions or prompting strategies

**Monitoring and Feedback**:
- **Continuous Evaluation**: Regular testing on benchmark datasets
- **User Feedback Loops**: Collect and incorporate user corrections
- **Error Analysis**: Systematic analysis of failure modes and edge cases
- **Version Control**: Track model performance across different deployments
