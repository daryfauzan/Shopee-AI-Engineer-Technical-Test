**Data Loading and Memory Management Strategy**

To efficiently process the large `customers-2000000.csv` dataset (approximately 2 million records) while minimizing memory footprint, a `dask.dataframe` approach was implemented.  The primary advantage of `dask.dataframe` over traditional `pandas` dataframes is its ability to handle datasets that exceed available system memory.

1.  **`dask.dataframe` Partitioning:**

    *   The core strategy involves using the `dask.dataframe` library (`import dask.dataframe as dd`). Unlike `pandas`, which loads the entire dataset into memory, `dask` intelligently partitions the CSV file into smaller, manageable chunks. These partitions are stored on disk and only loaded into memory on an as-needed basis.

2.  **Implementation Details:**

    *   **`load_data` Function:** The data loading process is encapsulated within the `load_data` function, which is critical for memory-efficient loading. Specifically, `dd.read_csv(file_path, **kwargs)` is used. The `dd.read_csv()` function does *not* immediately read the entire CSV file. Instead, it analyzes the file structure and creates metadata describing how the file can be divided into partitions. Only the metadata is loaded into memory at this stage.

3.  **Lazy Evaluation and Task Graph:**

    *   `dask` employs a lazy evaluation paradigm. When operations such as `df.set_index("Index")` are performed, `dask` does not immediately execute them. Rather, it constructs a *task graph*, a representation of the sequence of operations to be performed. This task graph is a dependency network of computations.

4. **Memory Monitoring:**
    * Profiler, via the `@profiler` decorator. It will provide insights into memory usage as the data loading process moves along.

5.  **Benefits of this Approach:**

    *   **Reduced Memory Consumption:** By loading data in partitions only when necessary, and by delaying computations, this method avoids loading the entire dataset into memory at any single time.
    *   **Parallel Processing:** `dask` is designed to leverage multiple cores, which can drastically reduce processing time as operations are applied across partitions in parallel.
    *   **Scalability:** The `dask.dataframe` approach scales effectively to datasets that are significantly larger than available RAM.

In essence, by utilizing `dask.dataframe` with its partitioning and lazy evaluation capabilities, the system is able to efficiently process the large CSV file while maintaining a low memory footprint, preventing potential memory-related errors and enabling faster processing times. The `profiler` is used for memory monitoring.
